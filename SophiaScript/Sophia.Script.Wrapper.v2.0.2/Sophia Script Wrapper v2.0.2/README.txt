File: README.TXT for 'Sophia Script Wrapper v2.0' created by https://benchtweakgaming.com/2020/10/10/windows-10-debloat-tool/
Created for farag2 Windows 10 Sophia Script: https://github.com/farag2/Windows-10-Sophia-Script

INTRODUCTION
------------
Please read this document to understand how to use this program.

BenchTweakGaming.com now works with the farag2 team.

This program create a PowerShell script file that you can run to tweak/'Debloat' Windows 10 based on farag2 
Windows 10 Sophia Script. It serves as a front-end GUI for the Sophia Script. It is called a Wrapper.

The options are arranged in different tabs and there is a Default preset in the menu so you can debloat a 
set of options. You can choose the Default preset first and then add your own choices. You can also create your own 
Sophia script to share and open it up. There is a Opposite menu option to select the alternative selections.
There are ToolTips balloon message popups for detailed info for each item. There are different languages in menu.

After choosing your options, you can directly run the PowerShell script from the program after creating your script. 
To do so, import preset 'Sophia.ps1', as this also gets the path for files to run directly, then fill in your choices, 
click the ‘Refresh Console’ button and then click ‘Run Powershell’ button. The “Run PowerShell” button 
creates a PowerShell script called ‘Sophia_edited.ps1’ in the same directory as 'Sophia.ps1' and runs it.

OR save the PowerShell script as 'Sophia.ps1' with the farag2 Sophia files (see heading SOPHIA FILES below) 
and run it using the following commands.

Launch PowerShell (Run as administrator) and navigate to where your script is.

1. Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
2. ./Sophia.ps1
