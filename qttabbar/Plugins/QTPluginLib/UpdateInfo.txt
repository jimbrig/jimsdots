QTTabBar 128

 - A change of the implementation of ITab in QTTabBar.dll - Added codes that guarantee equality. If 2 ITab objects point to the same tab, now they are identical.
 - Implements IPluginServer.HitTest( Point ) method - it always returned a tab over which mouse cursor was located. Now it works.
 - If no tabbar enabled, threre was no easy way to get current path from IPluginServer. Now IPluginServer.SelectedTab returns an ITab instance that contains information of current path even if TabBar is not enabled, as a temporary repair.

 QTPluginLib.dll is not rebuilt, but upadate is scheduled in the next major release of QTTabBar.
