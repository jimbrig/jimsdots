# You can comment out anything above that you do not want to delete such as log or license files with a # at the front of the line.
# File deletion statements (Remove-Item) are purposely grouped for easy disabling based on types of files.
# 
# LEGEND:
# * .log files that are not the most current one
# * .zip, .rar, .iso, and various archive files left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
# * .zip.txt and other archive-extensions.txt are lists of files that were extracted from an archive file for installation
# * .msi, .msu, and .msp are Microsoft intall packages left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
# * .ignore files are created to not shim executables during package install but not needed after shim operations are finished (This may change in a # future version of Chocolatey.)
# * credits.txt are program credits (of contributors) files you can read on the web
# * readme.txt files you can read on the web
# * .md files are usually markdown readme files that you can read on the web
# * .old files are Chocolatey files that have been replaced by newer versions (exe's and dll's mostly)
# * chocolatey.config.backup is a backup of your chocolatey.config file
# * _processed.txt - I have no idea what made this file
# * lib-bad holds packages that failed to install and lib-bkp contains aborted packages (during updates?) 
# * archives and executables out of .nuspkg files which are ZIP archives with NuGet package information - this is similar to what [Package Reducer](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-package-reducer) does
# * \Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\chocolatey is where new package files are downloaded to during pre-installation (if you haven't changed your cacheLocation in chocolatey.config)
# * license.txt and verification.txt files are included when packages include binaries, you can read them on the package web page, programname.license.txt files are license files for Chocolatey default tools
# * NuGet cach is where NuGet stores cached .nupkg files
