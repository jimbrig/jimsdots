Use edge://version to retrieve PATH where profile specific settings are stored in %localappdata% for Edge.

Can extract "database" flat files using DB Browser SQLite application.

I exported keywords.csv from that, which houses information on my custom SearchEngines "edge://settings/searchEngines".
